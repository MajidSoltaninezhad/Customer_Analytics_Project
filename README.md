# 🧠 Customer Analytics Project

## 📊 Overview

This project focuses on **analyzing customer behavior**, **predicting churn**, and **generating data-driven insights** for better business decisions.  
The workflow follows **Descriptive → Predictive → Prescriptive Analytics** using Python and Power BI.

---

## 1️⃣ Step 1: Find Dataset

We need a realistic customer dataset.  
Free and reliable sources include:

- **[Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)** (recommended)
- **Customer Segmentation Dataset**  
  Includes customer demographics, spending scores, gender, age, and income.
- **Online Retail Dataset**  
  Transaction-level data ideal for RFM analysis, customer retention, and sales prediction.
- **Telco Customer Churn**  
  Perfect for churn prediction modeling.

💡 **Tip:**  
Start with **Telco Customer Churn** or **Online Retail** datasets for predictive analytics.

3️⃣ Step 3: Tools & Libraries
Step	Tools / Libraries	Purpose
Data Cleaning	Python (Pandas, NumPy)	Handle missing values, duplicates, and data types
EDA	Python (Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas)	Understand customer behavior, trends, and correlations
Feature Engineering	Python	Create new columns such as RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
Predictive Modeling	Scikit-learn	Predict churn, sales, or segment customers
Dashboard	Power BI	Visualize customer KPIs interactively
Optional	Plotly, Dash	Build interactive dashboards in Python

4️⃣ Step 4: Business Questions
🔹 Descriptive Analytics (Past Behavior)
Which customers generate the most revenue?

Which segment spends the most on average?

Which regions have the highest number of loyal customers?

How many active vs. churned customers exist?

🔹 Predictive Analytics
Which customers are likely to churn next month?

What will next month’s revenue look like?

Which products or services are most likely to be purchased?

🔹 Prescriptive Analytics
What actions can we take to prevent churn?

Which customers should we target with promotions?

How can we increase average customer lifetime value?

5️⃣ Step 5: Step-by-Step Workflow
🧹 Phase 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation
Remove duplicates and handle missing values

Convert columns to proper data types

Create calculated fields (e.g., RFM values)

🔍 Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform descriptive statistics and correlations

Visualize top customers, regions, and products

Segment customers by behavior

🧩 Phase 3: Feature Engineering
Create RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features

Apply one-hot encoding to categorical variables

Normalize numeric columns if required

🤖 Phase 4: Predictive Modeling
Split data into training/testing sets

Build churn prediction (Logistic Regression / Random Forest)

Forecast sales using regression models

Evaluate models with accuracy, precision, recall, or RMSE

💡 Phase 5: Prescriptive Insights
Identify at-risk customers

Recommend retention actions

Suggest cross-selling and upselling opportunities

📈 Phase 6: Dashboard & Reporting
Import clean data and predictions into Power BI

Create interactive visuals:

Customer segments

Revenue by region

Churn probability

RFM distribution

Export insights as PDF or PowerPoint

6️⃣ Step 6: Example KPIs to Track
KPI	Description
Total Revenue per Customer	Total amount spent by each customer
Average Revenue per Segment	Average customer spending in each segment
Number of Churned Customers	Total customers lost within a period
Churn Probability per Customer	Likelihood of customer leaving soon
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)	Predicted long-term value of a customer
Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)	Revenue earned monthly from subscriptions or repeat buyers

🧠 Final Notes
Start small with one dataset (e.g., Telco Churn).

Build analysis incrementally (data cleaning → model → dashboard).

Use Power BI or Python dashboards for visual storytelling.

Continuously refine your model as you gain insights.
